priority queue real time scenario?
************************************

2. Task Management Application:

Use Case: A to-do list app where tasks can be prioritized (e.g., urgent tasks over less important ones).

Implementation: Tasks are stored in a priority queue, allowing users to retrieve and complete the highest-priority tasks first.
6. Search Engines:

Use Case: When processing search results, relevant pages can be prioritized based on factors like freshness and relevance.

Implementation: Search results are managed in a priority queue, with the most relevant results presented at the top.



7. Recommendation Systems:

Use Case: E-commerce platforms suggest products based on user behavior and preferences.

Implementation: Items are ranked in a priority queue based on user ratings and past purchase behavior to optimize recommendations.

6. Database Query Optimization
Priority queues are employed in database management systems for query optimization and scheduling. By prioritizing certain queries over others, the database can enhance performance, reduce latency, and optimize resource utilization. This is particularly valuable in environments with high volumes of transactions and multiple simultaneous users.
2. Task Scheduling in Operating Systems
Operating systems implement priority queues for scheduling tasks and managing CPU resources. In these systems, processes are assigned different priority levels, and the scheduler selects high-priority processes for execution before lower-priority ones. This approach improves system responsiveness and ensures that time-sensitive tasks receive the necessary resources.

1. Hospital Emergency Rooms
In hospital emergency rooms, priority queues are utilized to manage patient treatment based on the severity of their conditions. Critical patients are processed first, enhancing the effectiveness of emergency care and potentially saving lives. This real-time triage system allows medical staff to allocate immediate attention to the most urgent cases.


HashmAp vs concurrent Hashmap?
*****************************

1.->HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap are both key-value data structures in Java 

2.use:
HashMap: It is not thread-safe, meaning it cannot be safely used in a multi-threaded environment without external synchronization.
 If multiple threads access a HashMap simultaneously and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally (inserts, deletes, etc.), 
 it may lead to unpredictable behavior, including data corruption.
 
 
 ConcurrentHashMap:
It is thread-sae and specifically designed for use in concurrent environments. Multiple threads can read and write to the map concurrently without causing data inconsistency
. It uses a finer-grained locking mechanism (usually referred to as segment-based locking or bucket-level locking) that allows threads to operate on different segments of the map without interfering with each other.


3.Null Values
HashMap: Allows null keys and null values.
ConcurrentHashMap: Does not allow null keys or null values. This is because null values can cause ambiguity in concurrent environments where it’s difficult to determine if a null return is due to the absence of a key or a key associated with a null value.


4. Locking Mechanism
HashMap: In a multi-threaded context, you must manually synchronize access to the HashMap, for example, by using a synchronized block or using Collections.synchronizedMap(), 
which synchronizes the entire map.

ConcurrentHashMap: Uses a more sophisticated locking mechanism, where the map is divided into segments or buckets. Only the relevant bucket is locked for updates, making it much more efficient than synchronizing the entire map.


5. Iteration
HashMap: If you iterate over a HashMap while it’s being modified by another thread, it will throw a ConcurrentModificationException unless proper synchronization is applied.

ConcurrentHashMap: It does not throw ConcurrentModificationException because of its thread-safe nature. However, the iterators returned by ConcurrentHashMap are weakly consistent.
 This means that they do not reflect changes after the iterator is created but are safe to use even if the map is being concurrently modified.
